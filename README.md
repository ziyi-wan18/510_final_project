Palworld Pal Stats Calculator

## 2.A single sentence to impress me about your project
Nowadays, with the popularity of PalWorld, an open world and development game, players urgently require a tool to analyze the potential development of a Pal. Every player is trying their best to defeat the final BOSS: Jetragon, but the resource players could get is limited and they need to figure out  which pal will be more powerful in a fight. So, a comparison tool will be the key to help players to determine which Pal they should develop and train.

## 3.Technologies used
- Scrap the data from PalWorld official database or players forum  

- Streamlit to deploy the web

- Streamlit to visualize the Pals’ value as a chart to show the status of Pals


## 4.What problems you are trying to solve
We aim to address the challenge of helping users select the most suitable Pal in PalWorld by providing comparisons of various attributes among Pals. This involves retrieving data on different levels of Pals and visualizing abstract numerical values to aid in decision-making.

## 5.How to run
use “streamlit run app.py”

## 6.Reflections
- What you learned：I've gained proficiency in web scraping to collect data, developed an understanding of game mechanics and numerical setups, and identified basic patterns. Additionally, I've learned to transform data into charts, create interactive elements such as draggable axes for controlling parameters like character levels, and effectively design webpage layouts.
  
- What questions/problems did you face?：During the web scraping process, we encountered instances where the Pal names appeared as "N/A," but this issue has since been resolved. Additionally, we faced challenges with chart rendering when only one Pal was selected, leading to errors; however, these issues have been successfully resolved.
